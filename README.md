# PitchPerfect
For IOS Developer Course Completion - Project 1

This cool app will allow you to record your voice and play it back again with different cool sounds like squirrel and Darth Vader.

I used Two ViewControllers, one for recording, and one for playing the recordings.
I also used a ready a ready made extension provided by Udacity and used the already implemented methods for changing the recording's picthes.

Enjoy playing with your voice XD.
